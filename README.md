# JavaVoiceTextChatRoom
Multi user voice &amp; messaging client and server. TCP session management. UDP data distribution.

Currently under development.
No stable master branch at the moment.

Developed to learn about TCP/UDP/NAT. Inspired by voice/text chats like mumble, TeamSpeak and discord.

Input server IP into the client, the connection will be established if the server is online.
Only one connection to a server can be made from a client, in its current state.
